    <h1>Blackbird - The Beatles</h1>
    <h2>The Song</h2>

    <p>"Blackbird" is a song by the Beatles from their 1968 double album The Beatles (also known as "the White Album"), which was performed as a solo effort by Paul McCartney. The song was also written by McCartney, although it is credited to Lennon–McCartney. McCartney has stated that the lyrics of the song were inspired by hearing the call of a blackbird in Rishikesh, India, as well as by the unfortunate state of race relations in the United States in the 1960s.</p>
    <strong>The Lyrics</strong>

    <p>Blackbird singing in the dead of night<br/>
Take these broken wings and learn to fly<br/>
All your life<br/>
You were only waiting for this moment to arise<br/><br/>
Blackbird singing in the dead of night<br/>
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see<br/>
All your life<br/>
You were only waiting for this moment to be free<br/><br/>
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly<br/>
Into the light of the dark black night<br/>
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly<br/>
Into the light of the dark black night<br/><br/>
Blackbird singing in the dead of night<br/>
Take these broken wings and learn to fly<br/>
All your life<br/>
You were only waiting for this moment to arise<br/>
You were only waiting for this moment to arise</p>
